PassKeepr is an open-source app built using SwiftUI to create, edit, and manage custom Apple Wallet passes (`.pkpass` files)

## Features

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for supported features and associated versions

## Planned Work
* Support direct creation of contact cards (`vCard`s) in the "Customize QR Code" view (this is currently partially supported by scanning an existing vCard QR code)
* Support rendering custom text and/or other information (custom rendered QR code, icons, etc) into the strip image
* Support additional barcode formats
* Support notes/back field text
* Support importing and editing existing signed `.pkpass`es (i.e. from other apps or shared from friends)
* Improve drag and drop reordering performance/fluidity
